## Feature Deep Dives

### Spanish ML Categorization Engine

**Training Data**: 
- 10,000+ Mexican receipts with native Spanish categorization
- Cultural spending patterns (family gatherings, religious events)
- Regional variations (Northern vs Southern Mexico spending)

**Learning Loop**:
1. User receives ML categorization suggestion
2. User confirms/corrects via WhatsApp or mobile app  
3. Feedback updates model weights for similar receipts
4. Model accuracy improves through community usage

**Cultural Intelligence**:
- **Semantic Understanding**: "Oxxo" vs "7-Eleven" â†’ Convenience Store
- **Cultural Context**: "DulcerÃ­a" â†’ Candy Store (not Restaurant)
- **Family Patterns**: Multiple recipients â†’ Family Expense sharing

### Persona-Optimized Workflows

**Maria (Working Mother)**:
- WhatsApp receipt photo â†’ Auto-categorization â†’ Family budget update
- Target: <30 seconds from photo to insight
- Context: Managing household budget while working full-time

**Carlos (Small Business Owner)**:
- Batch mobile upload â†’ Business category separation â†’ Tax export
- Target: <2 minutes for 20 receipts from capture to categorized export
- Context: Preparing monthly business expense reports

### Cultural Validation Framework

**Advisory Board Composition**:
- 2 Financial literacy advocates from Hispanic community
- 2 Small business owners (Mexican-American)  
- 2 Working mothers (multi-generational households)
