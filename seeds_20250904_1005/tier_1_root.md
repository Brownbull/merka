# Tier 1: Root (MVP)
*Spanish-first Receipt Scanning Platform - Core Value Proposition*

## Overview
**Duration**: 8 weeks | **Budget**: $35,000 | **Features**: 20% complete

The Root tier establishes the core value proposition: Hispanic families can scan receipts via WhatsApp and receive basic Spanish categorization. This MVP proves the fundamental concept while building a solid technical foundation.

## Core Features

### 🚀 WhatsApp Business Integration
- **Tasks**: t001, t009
- **Value**: Primary channel for Hispanic user engagement
- **Deliverable**: Users send receipt photos via WhatsApp, get instant confirmation

### 🔍 Basic OCR Processing  
- **Tasks**: t002, t011
- **Value**: Text extraction from Mexican receipts
- **Deliverable**: >80% accuracy on common Mexican receipt formats

### 🔒 Security Foundation
- **Tasks**: t003, t019
- **Value**: Trust through data protection and user management
- **Deliverable**: AES-256 encrypted storage + JWT authentication

### 🗂️ Spanish Categorization
- **Tasks**: t006
- **Value**: Cultural authenticity in financial categories
- **Deliverable**: Hispanic spending taxonomy (Supermercado, Gasolina, Farmacia)

### 📤 Receipt Processing Pipeline
- **Tasks**: t010
- **Value**: Reliable photo upload and validation system
- **Deliverable**: Flask microservice handling receipt workflow

| t002 | SYRA | Design dual OCR provider architecture | 5 | ✅ |
| t003 | SYRA | Design secure receipt image storage | 6 | ✅ |
| t006 | VIVA | Define Spanish-first business taxonomy | 6 | ✅ |
| t009 | MAKA | Implement WhatsApp webhook API endpoints | 8 | ✅ |
| t010 | MAKA | Build Flask microservice for receipt upload | 6 | ✅ |
| t011 | MAKA | Implement Google Vision OCR integration | 7 | ✅ |
| t019 | MAKA | Implement JWT authentication system | 5 | ✅ |

**Total Effort**: 51 points across 8 tasks

## Agent Allocation

| Agent | Tasks | Effort Points | Workload |
|-------|-------|---------------|----------|
| **SYRA** | 3 | 19 | Architecture & system design |
| **VIVA** | 1 | 6 | Cultural taxonomy definition |
| **MAKA** | 4 | 26 | Core backend implementation |

## Success Criteria

### Technical Gates
- [ ] **OCR Accuracy**: >80% text extraction on Mexican receipts
- [ ] **Upload Success**: >95% photo upload success rate via WhatsApp  
- [ ] **Response Time**: End-to-end processing <60 seconds
- [ ] **Security**: AES-256 encryption operational, JWT auth functional

### User Experience
- [ ] **Spanish Categories**: >75% automated categorization accuracy
- [ ] **WhatsApp Flow**: Users complete photo→category flow without confusion
- [ ] **Cultural Validation**: Spanish speakers rate taxonomy >4.0/5.0

### Business Validation
- [ ] **Core Value Proof**: Hispanic families prefer WhatsApp over traditional apps
- [ ] **Retention Signal**: >40% users send second receipt within 7 days
- [ ] **Processing Reliability**: <5% failed receipt processing rate

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks
1. **WhatsApp Business API Approval Delays**
   - *Mitigation*: Start application process immediately, prepare SMS backup
   - *Contingency*: t001 includes alternative webhook design

2. **OCR Accuracy on Mexican Receipts**
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing with regional receipt formats
   - *Foundation*: t002 designs dual-provider architecture for Tier 2

3. **Spanish Category Cultural Mismatch**
   - *Mitigation*: VIVA agent focuses on authentic Hispanic taxonomy
   - *Validation*: Native Spanish speaker review required

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### External Dependencies
- WhatsApp Business API approval (7-14 day process)
- Google Vision API account setup
- S3 bucket configuration for secure image storage
- PostgreSQL database provisioning

### Key Assumptions
- Hispanic families prefer WhatsApp over mobile app downloads
- Mexican receipt formats are consistent enough for basic parsing
- Spanish category taxonomy can achieve >75% accuracy without ML
- JWT authentication sufficient for MVP security requirements

## Graduation Criteria

**Ready for Tier 2 when:**
- ✅ All 8 tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ WhatsApp→OCR→categorization pipeline functional end-to-end
- ✅ Security foundation passes basic vulnerability scan
- ✅ Spanish categorization validated by Hispanic advisory board
- ✅ Performance baseline established for optimization in Tier 3

## Technical Foundation for Growth

This tier establishes critical patterns for scaling:
- **Microservice Architecture**: Flask services ready for horizontal scaling
- **Provider Abstraction**: OCR design supports multiple providers (Tier 2)
- **Cultural Framework**: Spanish taxonomy extensible with ML (Tier 3)  
- **Security-First**: Encryption and auth patterns for compliance (Tier 3)

**Next**: Tier 2 adds dual OCR failover, mobile app, and analytics dashboard to create a competitive product experience.
