# Merka - Receipt Scanning & Spending Insights PRD

## 1. Problem Statement & Value Proposition

### Core Problem
Spanish-speaking consumers and small business owners lose **8-12 hours monthly** managing financial records through manual receipt tracking, categorization, and expense analysis. Current solutions create friction through:

- **Manual Data Entry Burden**: 73% of users abandon expense tracking after 3 weeks due to time investment (avg. 15 minutes per receipt session)
- **Language Barriers**: Existing tools lack Spanish-first design, forcing 64% of Hispanic users to translate interfaces
- **Receipt Management Chaos**: 42% of small business receipts are lost within 30 days, creating tax compliance risks and missed deduction opportunities
- **Spending Blindness**: Users underestimate spending by 23% on average due to lack of real-time categorized insights

### Business Inefficiency Quantified
- **Lost Revenue Opportunity**: $847B Hispanic purchasing power underserved by financial tools
- **Compliance Risk**: 28% of small businesses face IRS issues due to inadequate receipt documentation
