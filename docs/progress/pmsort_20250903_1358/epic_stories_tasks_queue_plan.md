## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- OCR accuracy below 90%: Parallel Azure implementation (T012) provides fallback
- ML training insufficient: Large dataset curation (T049) with continuous monitoring (T063)
- Family complexity: Extensive user testing (T044, T047, T075) validates design

**Cultural Risks**:
- Language authenticity: Native speaker validation (T033) and style guides (T027)  
- Category appropriateness: Cultural advisory board (T028) and user testing (T038, T074)
- Accessibility gaps: Comprehensive testing framework (T045, T046, T051, T052)

**Market Risks**:
- Competitive response: Feature differentiation strategy in strategic tasks
- User adoption: WhatsApp-native integration and family-oriented design
- Monetization: Validated freemium model with Chilean market research
