## Prioritization Method

**Priority Levels**:
- **P1 (High)**: Blocks core development or regulatory compliance (9 questions)
- **P2 (Medium)**: Impacts feature scope or user experience (13 questions)
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have or future consideration (2 questions)

**Impact Assessment**:
Priority = Impact (user/business success) Ã— Urgency (development blocker degree)

**Decision Timeline Requirements**:
- **P1 Questions**: Decisions needed within 2-4 weeks to prevent development blocking
- **P2 Questions**: Decisions needed within 4-8 weeks for feature completeness
- **P3 Questions**: Decisions can be deferred to post-MVP phases

## Escalation Framework

**Green (Normal Process)**: P3 questions, standard research and advisory board consultation
**Yellow (Accelerated)**: P2 questions requiring cross-functional team alignment and community input
**Red (Executive Decision Required)**: P1 questions blocking development or creating compliance risk

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate P1 Resolution** (Weeks 1-2):
   - Market targeting strategy (Q1, Q2)
   - Technical architecture decisions (Q6, Q8, Q10)
   - Compliance framework establishment (Q16, Q18)

2. **P2 Strategic Alignment** (Weeks 3-6):
   - Cultural strategy refinement (Q3, Q11-Q15)
   - Business model validation (Q19-Q21)
   - Partnership strategy development (Q5, Q22, Q24)

3. **P3 Future Planning** (Post-MVP):
   - Regional localization depth (Q13)
   - Advanced partnership opportunities (Q23)

All questions include specific agent ownership assignments and require structured decision documentation with rationale and implementation implications.
