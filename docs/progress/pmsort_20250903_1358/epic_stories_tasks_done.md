## Completed Items

### Documentation & Strategic Analysis (Completed)

**Completed Evidence**: Based on PRD metadata and completion indicators found in source files

#### Planning & Analysis Tasks
- [x] (VIVA) Product Requirements Document creation and validation
  **Completed Evidence**: PRD.refined.md shows "status: READY" and "agent_coordination: COMPLETE" (line 17)
  **Completion Details**: Comprehensive PRD with 8.70/10 overall score, complete cross-agent coordination

- [x] (QRA) Cross-agent metrics consolidation and validation  
  **Completed Evidence**: PRD.md:1691 states "Cross-agent metrics consolidation completed with unified instrumentation plan, comprehensive risk management framework established, and strategic decision framework validated for Hispanic market opportunity"
  **Completion Details**: Unified instrumentation plan established with comprehensive risk management framework

## Partial Completion Status

No Stories or Epics show complete delivery evidence. All core development work (receipt processing, Spanish-first UX, categorization engine, etc.) remains in planning/design phase based on PRD documentation.

## Implementation Readiness Assessment

**Ready for Implementation**:
- Strategic direction validated (VIVA coordination complete)
- Technical architecture defined (comprehensive PRD.refined.md specifications)
- Quality gates established (detailed testing and validation criteria)
- Cultural requirements documented (extensive Hispanic market analysis)
- Risk mitigation strategies defined (comprehensive risk management framework)

**Next Phase Dependencies**:
All Epic implementation is blocked pending:
- Development team resource allocation
- Technical infrastructure setup (Flask/React/PostgreSQL stack)
- WhatsApp Business API account provisioning
- Mexican market user research validation
- Cultural advisory board establishment

## Notes on Completion Detection

The source documentation contains primarily strategic planning and requirements definition. No evidence of actual software implementation, deployed features, or user-validated functionality was found. The "completed" items represent planning and analysis deliverables rather than user-facing product capabilities.

The PRD completion represents a significant milestone in the strategic planning phase, with all major questions addressed and agent coordination confirmed. However, all user-facing features and technical implementation remain in the queue for development.
