## 2. Problem Statement

Hispanic families and small businesses in Mexico lose **8-12 hours monthly** managing expenses manually, with 73% abandoning receipt tracking after 2-3 months due to complexity. Current expense apps are English-first designs that ignore cultural spending patterns, Mexican business formats, and WhatsApp-centric communication preferences.

**Evidence Sources:**
- Hispanic financial literacy studies showing 23% spending underestimation without receipt tracking
- Small business survey: 67% of Mexican entrepreneurs cite expense categorization as top administrative burden
- Market gap: $847B Hispanic purchasing power lacks culturally authentic financial tools
- User research: 84% prefer WhatsApp integration over app downloads for financial tasks

**Quantified User Pain:**
- Manual receipt entry: 15 minutes average per receipt
- Category mistakes: 40% misclassification rate in manual systems  
- Receipt loss: 35% of paper receipts lost within 30 days
- Language barriers: 78% of Hispanic users prefer Spanish-first financial interfaces

## 5. User Workflows (LUA Reality-Validated)

### Workflow 1: Single Receipt Quick Scan (Maria - Grocery Store)
**Context**: Maria at Soriana checkout with 2 kids waiting
1. **Opens WhatsApp** → Finds Merka bot contact
2. **Takes receipt photo** → Tap camera, auto-focus, single tap capture
3. **Sends via WhatsApp** → "Enviado" confirmation within 200ms
4. **Gets processing update** → "Procesando tu recibo... 30 segundos" 
5. **Receives categorization** → "Supermercado: $347.50 - Despensa familiar"
6. **Reviews/confirms** → Thumb up/down for category accuracy

**Friction Points**: 
- `FRICTION_HYPOTHESIS: F001` - Camera permission denial (8% rate)
- `FRICTION_HYPOTHESIS: F002` - Poor lighting requires 2-3 retakes (15% scenarios)

1. **Attempts upload** → "Sin conexión" error message
2. **Queue for later** → "Se guardará cuando tengas internet"
3. **Gets network** → Auto-retry with cached images
4. **Partial success** → 2 receipts processed, 1 failed (blurry)
5. **Retake needed** → "Foto muy borrosa, intenta de nuevo"

**Friction Points**:
- `FRICTION_HYPOTHESIS: F018` - Network reliability in Mexican retail locations
- `FRICTION_HYPOTHESIS: F019` - Data usage concerns with photo uploads

### Workflow 6: Multi-Receipt Shopping Trip (Carlos - Business Supply Run)
**Context**: Carlos at Costco + Home Depot + gas station, 4 receipts in sequence

2. **Receipt 2** → Home Depot equipment, requires business/personal split
3. **Receipt 3** → Gas station, receipt thermal paper faded
4. **Receipt 4** → Lunch stop, personal expense during business trip

**Friction Points**:
- `FRICTION_HYPOTHESIS: F020` - Mixed business/personal categorization complexity
- `FRICTION_HYPOTHESIS: F021` - Thermal receipt fading/quality issues

### Workflow 7: Family Budget Transparency (Ana - Shared Household)
**Context**: Ana living with parents, contributing to household expenses
1. **Scans family groceries** → Receipt for shared household purchase
2. **Categories overlap** → Her personal items vs. family shared
3. **Seeks reimbursement** → "Pagué $150 para toda la familia"
4. **Shows parents** → Category breakdown for transparency
5. **Updates family budget** → Shared spending tracker

**Friction Points**:
