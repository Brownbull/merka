# Flask + React Stack

## Overview
A lightweight Python + JavaScript stack where Flask provides a minimal backend and React powers the frontend. Ideal for small business tools that need data insights or AI integration without the overhead of a large framework.

---

## Components
- **Backend**: Flask
  - Language: Python
  - Microframework: Flask
  - ORM: SQLAlchemy or Peewee
  - Auth: Flask-Login, JWT
  - APIs: Flask-RESTful, Flask-Smorest

- **Frontend**: React
  - Language: JavaScript/TypeScript
  - State Mgmt: Redux Toolkit, React Query
  - Styling: TailwindCSS, Chakra UI

- **Database**
  - PostgreSQL (common choice)
  - SQLite (lightweight dev)
  - Redis (cache, sessions)

- **AI/Data Integration**
  - Native Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
  - AI APIs: OpenAI, Hugging Face
  - Background jobs: Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ

## Typical Architecture
- Flask as REST/GraphQL API
- React SPA consuming API
- DB access via SQLAlchemy
- Worker queues (Celery) for async AI/data tasks

---

## Strengths
- Very flexible, minimal boilerplate
- Excellent AI/data support in Python
- Easy to scale via microservices

---

## Weaknesses
- Less out-of-the-box structure
- Requires more manual wiring than Django or Rails
- Scaling monoliths can become messy

---

## Testing
- Backend: pytest, unittest, coverage.py
- Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library
- Integration: Cypress

---

## Deployment Options
- Docker + Gunicorn + Nginx
- Render, Railway, Fly.io
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Lambda (serverless)

---

## Best Use Cases
- AI/data-focused apps
- Lightweight business tools
- Proof-of-concepts that may grow later
