# Bloom Prompt: c2ad7abd630c

## What (Task)
Define OCR service abstraction layer architecture
Agent: SYRA  
Estimated Duration: 2 day(s)

## Why (Context)
Tier: 1 - MVP  
Epic: OCR Processing Engine  
Story: Dual OCR Implementation  
Strategic Intent: Extract text from Spanish receipts with 90% accuracy  
Dependency Summary: None â€“ entry task.

## How (Agent Modality)
Primary Agent: SYRA  
Relevant Responsibility Domains: Architecture, System Design, Service Abstraction  
Execution Guidance:
- Inputs: OCR provider requirements (Google Cloud Vision, Azure Computer Vision)
- Constraints: >90% accuracy on Mexican receipts, P95 processing time <5 seconds, provider switching capability
- Collaboration Signals: Handoff to MAKA for service implementations

## Minimum Expected Output
Describe the deliverable(s) that define DONE:
- Artifact(s): Service interface design with provider switching
- Verification: Abstraction layer supports dual OCR providers with failover
- Handoff: MAKA implements Google Vision and Azure services using this abstraction

## Acceptance Snippet
- Google Cloud Vision as primary OCR
- Azure Computer Vision as fallback
- >90% accuracy on Mexican receipts
- P95 processing time <5 seconds
